The various commands to be learnt -
1] mkdir folder_name -> for making a new folder or directory
2] cd folder_name -> change directory for entering into a folder or directory
3] git init -> for initializing a git repository
4] git status -> for knowing about unstaged files and git status
5] git add file_name/. -> for adding files to the staging area
6] git commit - m "Message_Name" -> for commiting the files in the git repository
7] git log -> for seeing all the logs of the commits that has been made
8] git reset commit_hash_id -> for getting back to the old commit whose id is passed
9] git stash -> for moving the changed files to the stash area in which they are saved and dont reflect any changes
10] git stash pop -> for adding the stashed files into the staging area again
11] git stash clear -> for removing the files from the stash area also (remember these files can never be retrieved back)
12] git remote add origin remote_git_repo_link -> for linking the local git repository to the github repository
13] git push origin master -> for adding all the local files to the remote github repository
14] git branch branch_name -> for creating a new branch

For contributing to an open source project -
STEPS-
1] Go to github and fork the project 
2] Select a local folder and go inside that folder to run -> git clone project_url
3] git clone project_url -> helps in cloning the remote project folder(repository) in the local folder
4] git remote add upstream project_url -> for linking to the original online repo
5] Make a new branch using -> git branch branch_name
6] Then commit the changes in that new branch using -> git commit -m "message"
7] Then push the changes as -> git push origin branch_name (here branch is the name of the new branch that is created)
8] Here it will create a new pull request that will be tested and merged by the owner of the project to which you are contributing to.
